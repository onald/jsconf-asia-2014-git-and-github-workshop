#### 1. View the log

This shows the verbose view of the commit log:
```
git log
```

The `git log` command has many options, so have a look at `git log --help`.

A useful variation is:
```
git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --decorate
```
Which shows a graphical representation of the commit log.
